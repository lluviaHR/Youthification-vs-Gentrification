# Youthification-vs-Gentrification
Spatial Analytics 

The current  generation, commonly referred as Millennials, is significantly  impacting the housing market, driving developers towards compact, mixed-use residential  developments that are close to transit. This trend raises several important issues for urban planning about housing and job creation in our cities, from the “ideal size” of an apartment  to the inclusion of alternative urban transportations systems.  For these reasons, this project is a first attempt to map and identify “youthification” processes in the City.

Youthification: Location Quotient
The location quotient (LQ) is an index for comparing a region’s share of a particular activity with the share of that same activity found at a more aggregate spatial level. By using the location quotient formula, a value that is close to 1 will be calculated in the result. If the result is 1, it shows that the neighborhood has the same percentage ratio for the category being considered relative to the whole region (NYC). A LQ value greater than 1 shows a relatively high concentration of a particular factor considered in that neighborhood compared to the whole region. In this case,  we have calculated the LQ values of age group 25-34.

Gentrification: 
We conduct a test to determine whether a neighborhood gentrified over a given time period based on the paper: Gentrification Report Methodology. We identified lower-income neighborhoods in New York City using the following criteria:
The neighborhood’s median household income is in the bottom 40th percentile when compared to all tracts within its metro area at the beginning of the decade.
The neighborhood’s median home value is in the bottom 40th percentile when compared to all tracts within its metro area at the beginning of the decade.
An increase in a neighborhood's educational attainment, as measured by the percentage of residents age 25 and over holding bachelor’s degrees, is in the top third percentile of all tracts within a metro area.
